### Hi there, I'm Max

I'm interested in all things embedded -- where the hardware meets the software

One of my favorite things to play around with is MIDI. I like creating widgets or instruments that use it to communicate.

Software is most powerful to me when it interacts with the physical world

#### Languages and Tools

C, Rust, Python, C#

KiCAD

#### Microcontrollers

Arduino (ATMega), STM32
